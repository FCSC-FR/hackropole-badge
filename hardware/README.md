This PCB was designed with a Kicad 9.0.

## Sending the PCB to production

We recommend the following settings when sending the design files to production:
  - FR-4 base material, 2 layers, 1.6mm thickness,
  - Blue color (to match the logo colors!),
  - Leadfree HASL surface finish, or ENIG (more expensive),
  - If your fab requires to place a mark on the PCB, you may use "Specify Position" and update the "JLCJLCJLCJLC" text.
