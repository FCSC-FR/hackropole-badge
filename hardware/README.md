This PCB was designed with Kicad 9.0.

## Sending the PCB to production

We recommend the following settings when sending the design files to production:

- FR-4 base material, 2 layers, 1.6mm thickness,
- Blue color (to match Hackropole colors!),
- Leadfree HASL surface finish, or ENIG (gold),
- If your fab requires to place a mark on the PCB, you may use
  "Specify Position" and update the "JLCJLCJLCJLC" text.
